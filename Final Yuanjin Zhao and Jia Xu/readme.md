Our front end website is on codePen: http://codepen.io/Yuanjin/pen/uodDc
The JS code connects the menu bar and loading pictures are in the js folder.
The back end is inside the php folder, we made a form that could allow user to save their flower data with an unique id. We tested it in MAMP with Sequel Pro and it worked.
